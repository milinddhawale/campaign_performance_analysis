Assignment:
The assignment is to investigate and analyze the attached campaign performance data,
producing actionable insights for business and senior leadership team.
Please feel free use whichever tool/language of your choice to generate insights and how you
would recommend actioning them / prioritizing them. Prepare a 1-2 slide presentation that you
will walkthrough in the interview.

Deliverables:
1. The code you used to perform the work (please use comments to describe your
choices/steps).
2. A presentation that describes the results in 2-3 slides for a business audience. Assume the
audience has minimal technical knowledge.

Expectations:
We are looking to understand your familiarity with data analysis and insights generation. We
would also like to see your comfort level with creating business value from analytics.
We are not expecting you to work on this task for more than 8 hours. The data column names
are self explanatory, if you need to make certain assumption while using the fields, please call it
in your comments. If you find that you are spending too much time on the analysis section,
please feel free to explain in comments any additional steps that you would like to take if this
project were assigned to you in the role of a Sr. Analyst at BMO. For the presentation, feel free
to make any assumptions that will help you put together a business case. Our goal is to
understand how you structure the problem and how you connect data to insights for leadership
team/ business partners.
